## Environment

### Storybook

> Storybook in this project is used to display standalone styles and components, in a pure DOM environment unrelated to the renderer. It is intentionally isolated from any app-specific logic.

```plaintext
renderer/
    ├── lib/**/*.stories.ts # here
    └── ui/**/*.stories.ts # here
